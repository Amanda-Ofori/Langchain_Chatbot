Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, 
is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural 
intelligence displayed by humans and other animals, such as "learning" 
and "problem solving. . 
In computer science AI research is defined as the study of 
"intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and 
takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its 
goals.
 HOW ARE HUMANS INTELLIGENT ?
• Learning
• Reasoning
• Problem Solving and Creativity
• Social Behavior
• Experiencing our Environment with our senses:
• Hearing
• Sight
• Touch
• Taste
• Smelling

 Ways that People Think and Learn 
About Things 
• If you have a problem, think of a past situation 
where you solved a similar problem. 
• If you take an action, anticipate what might happen 
next. 
• If you fail at something, imagine how you might 
have done things differently. 
• If you observe an event, try to infer what prior event 
might have caused it. 
• If you see an object, wonder if anyone owns it. 
• If someone does something, ask yourself what the 
person's purpose was in doing that.

 This is what 
Humans do 
best

This is what 
Computers do best
Artificial intelligence (AI) - The study of computer systems that 
attempt to model and apply the intelligence of the human mind.
For example, writing a program to pick out objects in a picture:

 When we compare Humans to Machines, it is important to note that a 
Machine can be a car, a Smart Phone, a Digital Television, etc.

"human" and "machine" components of a system.   For a properly designed 
system, its important to know the capabilities and flexibilities of both.

 KEY RESEARCH AREAS IN AI
• Problem solving, planning, and search --- generic problem solving 
architecture based on ideas from cognitive science (game playing, 
robotics).
• Knowledge Representation – to store and manipulate information 
(logical and probabilistic representations)
• Automated reasoning / Inference – to use the stored information to 
answer questions and draw new conclusions
• Machine  Learning – intelligence from data; to adapt to new 
circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
• Natural Language Processing – to communicate with the machine
• Computer Vision --- processing visual information
• Robotics --- Autonomy, manipulation, full integration of AI 
capabilities
11
 From SIRI and Alexa, to self-driving cars, artificial 
intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly. 
While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like 
characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google’s search 
algorithms, to IBM’s Watson, to autonomous weapons.
Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI 
(or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow 
task such as only facial recognition, or only internet 
searches, or only driving a car). 
However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to 
create general AI (AGI or strong AI). 
While narrow AI may outperform humans at whatever its 
specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI 
would outperform humans at nearly every thinking task.

The potential benefits from self-learning computer chips are 
limitless as these types of devices can learn to perform the most 
complex thinking tasks, such as interpreting critical cardiac 
rhythms, detecting anomalies to prevent cyber-hacking and 
composing music.
This is a new one made by the Intel company and many other
complex thinking tasks, such as interpreting critical cardiac 
rhythms, detecting anomalies to prevent cyber-hacking and 
composing music.
This is a new one made by the Intel company and many other 
companies are making special AI chips too.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has entered our daily lives like never before 
and we are yet to unravel the many other ways in which it could flourish. 
All of the tech giants such as Microsoft, Uber, Google, Facebook, Apple, 
Amazon, Oracle, Intel, IBM or Twitter are competing in the race to lead 
the market and acquire the most innovative and promising AI 
businesses.

Google announced their Duplex system, a new technology for 
conducting natural conversations to carry out “real world” tasks over 
the phone. 
The technology is directed towards completing specific tasks, such 
as scheduling certain types of appointments. 
For such tasks, the system makes the conversational experience as 
natural as possible, allowing people to speak normally, like they 
would to another person, without having to adapt to a machine.

The answer is all of the above. 
Each of these highly realistic images were created by generative 
adversarial networks, or GANs.
GAN, a concept introduced by Google researcher Ian Goodfellow in 
2014, taps into the idea of “AI versus AI.” 
There are two neural networks: the generator, which comes up 
with a fake image (say a dog for instance), and a discriminator, 
which compares the result to real-world images and gives feedback 
to the generator on how close it is to replicating a realistic image.

The Turing Test
Turing test
A test to determine whether a computer has achieved intelligence
Alan Turing
An English mathematician who wrote a landmark paper in 1950 that 
asked the question: Can machines think?
He proposed a test to answer the question "How will we know when 
we have succeeded?“
He said that a machine passes the test when it successfully generates 
responses appropriate enough to convince the evaluator that it is 
human.
 30
In the Turing test, the interrogator must determine which 
respondent is the computer and which is the human.
 31
THE LOEBNER PRIZE FOR COMPLETING THE TURING TEST
The Loebner Prize is an annual competition in artificial 
intelligence that awards prizes to the computer 
programs considered by the judges to be the most human-
like, using the Turing Test computer and person arrangement.
The contest was launched in 1990 by Hugh Loebner and there 
are bronze, silver, and gold coin prizes, plus money.
•So far, there have only been winners of the bronze medal and a 
$4,000 award. 
 32
Silver – a one-time-only prize plus $25,000 offered for the first program 
that judges cannot distinguish from a real human.
Gold plus $100,000 for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from 
a real human in a Turing test that includes deciphering and understanding 
text, visual, and auditory input. 
Once this is achieved, the annual competition will end.

KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION
• We need to create a logical view of the data, based on how we want 
to process it
• Natural language is very descriptive, but does not lend itself to 
efficient processing.
____________________________________________________
What are the different ways that we can represent knowledge so it 
can be reviewed by an Artificial Intelligence computer program ?
1) Expert Learning Systems
2) Semantic Networks - A knowledge representation technique that 
focuses on the relationships and word descriptions of objects.   A graph 
is used to represent a semantic network or net
3) Decision or Search tree
4) Neural networks – creating a computer version of the neurons of the 
brain and how they work

1)  Expert Learning Systems
• Expert Learning Systems were commercially the first and most 
successful domain in Artificial Intelligence.
• Somewhat out of favor today
• These programs mimic the experts in whatever field is being 
studied.
Auto mechanic
Telephone networking
Cardiologist
Delivery routing
Organic compounds
Professional auditor
Mineral prospecting
Manufacturing
Infectious diseases
Pulmonary function
Diagnostic internal medicine
Weather forecasting
computer configuration
Battlefield tactician
Engineering structural analysis
Space-station life support  
Audiologist
Civil law
 • Rule-based or Expert systems - Knowledge bases 
consisting of hundreds or thousands of rules of the 
form:    
•
IF (condition) THEN (action).
•
Use rules to store knowledge (“rule-based”).
•
The rules are usually gathered from experts in the field being 
represented (“expert system”).
•
Most widely used knowledge model in the commercial world.
IF (it is raining AND you must go outside)
THEN (put on your raincoat)
• Rules can fire off a chain of other rules
IF (raincoat is on)
THEN (you will not get wet)
 Expert Systems
36
Gardener Expert System Example
 Expert Systems
Named abbreviations that represent conclusions:
• NONE—apply no treatment at this time
• TURF—apply a turf-building treatment
• WEED—apply a weed-killing treatment
• BUG—apply a bug-killing treatment
• FEED—apply a basic fertilizer treatment
• WEED & FEED—apply a weed-killing and fertilizer combination 
treatment
37
 Expert Systems
Variables that are needed to represent the 
state of the lawn
• BARE—the lawn has large, bare areas
• SPARSE—the lawn is generally thin
• WEEDS—the lawn contains many weeds
• BUGS—the lawn shows evidence of bugs
38
 Expert Systems
Data that is available:
• LAST—the date of the last lawn treatment
• CURRENT—current date
• SEASON—the current season
Now we can formulate some rules for our
gardening expert system 
Rules take the form of if-then statements
39
 Expert Systems
Some rules
• if (THE CURRENT DAY – LAST DAY IS LESS THAN 30) then 
NONE
• if (SEASON = winter) then not BUGS
• if (BARE) then TURF
• if (SPARSE and not WEEDS) then FEED
• if (BUGS and not SPARSE) then BUG
• if (WEEDS and not SPARSE) then WEED
• if (WEEDS and SPARSE) then WEED & FEED
40
 Expert Systems
An execution of our inference engine

• User: 
Yes
• System: 
Does the lawn contain significant weeds?
• User:

• System: 
You should apply a weed-killing and fertilizer  
combination treatment.

2) Semantic (word description) Networks
Semantic network
A knowledge representation technique that focuses on the 
relationships between objects
A directed graph or word chart is used to represent a semantic 
network or net
 3) Search Trees
AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. 
An algorithm is a set of instructions that a mechanical computer can 
execute.
A complex algorithm is often built on top of another, simpler, one 
and a common way to visualize it is with a tree design. 
43
 A simple example of an algorithm is 
the following recommendations for 
optimal play at tic-tac-toe:
If someone has a "threat" (that is, 
two in a row), take the remaining 
square. Otherwise,
If a move "forks" to create two 
threats at once, play that move. 
Otherwise,
Take the center square if it is free. 
Otherwise,
If your opponent has played in a 
corner, take the opposite corner. 
Otherwise,
Take an empty corner if one exists. 
Otherwise, 
Take any empty square.

An example is a Search tree for playing the game Tic-Tac-Toe, as shown 
below. 
This image depicts many of the possible paths that the game can take from 
the having the first 2 rows filled,

AI technology called machine learning today, is great at helping for 
taking good photos, translating languages, recognizing your friends 
on Facebook, delivering search results, screening out spam and many 
other chores. 
It usually uses an approach called neural networks that works 
something like a human brain, not a sequence of IF THIS, THEN steps 
as in traditional computing.
 49
TYPES AND FUNCTION OF NEURONS
Neurons are essential for every action that our body and brain carry out. 
It is the complexity of neuronal networks that gives us our personalities and 
our consciousness. 
They make up around 10 percent of the brain; the rest consists of glial cells 
and other cells that support and nourish the neurons.
 50
There are around 86 billion neurons in the brain.  To reach this huge 
target, a developing fetus must create around 250,000 neurons per 
minute !
Each neuron is connected to at least 10,000 others – giving well over 
1,000 trillion connections (1 quadrillion connections).
They all connect at a junction called a synapse, which can be electrical or a 
higher percentage of them are chemical. 
 51
Incoming signals to the neuron can be either excitatory – which means they 
tend to make the neuron fire (generate an electrical impulse) – or inhibitory –
which means that they tend to keep the neuron from firing.
A single neuron may have more than one set of dendrites, and may receive many 
thousands of input signals. 
Whether or not a neuron is excited into firing an impulse depends on the sum of 
all of the excitatory and inhibitory signals it receives.
If the neuron does end up firing, the nerve impulse is conducted down the axon.
 52
How synapses work - Neurons are connected to each other at a location 
called a Synapse, so that they can communicate messages
Amazingly, where each cell connects with the other one, NONE of 
these cells ever touch each other !!
The signal that is carried from the first nerve fiber to the next one is 
transmitted by an electrical signal or a chemical one, up to a speed 
of 268 miles per hour !
There is new evidence that both types closely interact with each other and 
that the transmission of a nerve signal is both chemical and electrical, 
which is actually required for normal brain development and function.

 53
If you don’t use a foreign language you learned years ago or 
mathematics, the neurons used for those things will move the 
synapses away from each other so they can do other things that 
you are learning to do.   This is called Synaptic Pruning.
 54
4) Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
A computer representation of knowledge that attempts to 
mimic the neural networks of the human brain
Yes, but what is a human neural network?
Neural networks, or neural nets, were inspired by the 
architecture of neurons in the human brain. 
A simple "neuron" N accepts input from multiple other 
neurons, each of which, when activated (or "fired"), cast a 
weighted "vote" for or against whether neuron N should itself 
activate.
 55
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial 
neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. 
Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a 
signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives 
a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons 
connected to it.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
• Artificial neurons: Commonly called processing elements, 
are modeled after real neurons of humans and other animals.
• Has many inputs and one output.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
• Artificial neurons: Commonly called processing elements, 
are modeled after real neurons of humans and other animals.
• Has many inputs and one output.
• The inputs are signals that are strengthened or weakened 
(weighted).
• If the sum of all the signals is strong enough, the neuron 
will put out a signal to the next neuron output of a 1.

Artificial Neural Networks
Training
The process of adjusting the weights and threshold values in a 
neural net 
How does this all work?
Train a neural net to recognize An eagle in a picture.
Given one output value per pixel, train network to produce an 
output value of 1 for every pixel that contributes to the eagle and 0 
for every one that doesn’t.
 58
DeepMind is a subsidiary of Google that focuses on the 
development of artificial intelligence and deep reinforcement 
machine learning.  
The deep reinforcement learning of its AI algorithms has been 
used in both research and applied contexts
DeepMind is built around the framework of neural networks and 
uses a method called deep-reinforced-learning. 
This means that the A.I can learn from it's experiences and 
become more efficient at whatever it does. 
The A.I is general-purpose meaning that it's NOT pre-programmed 
for a specific task from the go.

 Agents
• An agent is anything that can be viewed as a device that 
can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon 
that environment through actuators.
• Human agent: eyes, ears, and other organs for sensors; hands, 
legs, mouth, and other body parts for actuators
• Robotic agent: cameras and infrared range finders for sensors
• Various motors for actuators
• Rational Agent: 
• For each possible sequence, a rational agent should select an 
action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, 
given the evidence provided by the perception sequence and 
whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.
59
 Why “meaning” is the central concept of AI
• For an agent to be “intelligent”, it must be able to understand the 
meaning of information.
• Information is acquired / delivered / conveyed in messages which 
are phrased  in a selected representation language.
• There are two sides in information exchange: the source (text, 
image, person, program, etc.) and the receiver (person or an AI 
agent). They must speak the same “language” for the information 
to be exchanged in a meaningful way.
• The receiver must have the ability to interpret the information 
correctly according to the intended by the source meaning or semantics of 
it. 
MEANING = SEMANTICS

Machine Learning
The phrase ‘machine learning’ dates back to the middle of the last 
century where Arthur Samuel in 1959 defined machine learning as 
“the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”
Machine learning is a type of AI that helps a computer’s ability to 
learn and essentially teach itself to evolve as it becomes exposed 
to new and ever-changing data. 
For example, Facebook’s news feed uses machine learning in an 
effort to personalize each individual’s feed based on what they like.

Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a new area of machine learning research, which 
has been introduced with the objective of moving machine 
learning closer to artificial intelligence.
It relates to study of ‘deep neural networks’ in the human brain 
and, under this perspective, the deep learning tries to emulate 
the functions of inner layers of the human brain, creating 
knowledge from multiple layers of information processing. 
Since the deep learning technology is modelled after the human 
brain, each time new data is poured in, its capabilities get better.
Deep artificial neural networks are a set of algorithms 
reaching new levels of accuracy for many important
brain, each time new data is poured in, its capabilities get better.
Deep artificial neural networks are a set of algorithms 
reaching new levels of accuracy for many important 
problems, such as image recognition, sound recognition, 
recommender systems, etc.
 65
For example, a deep learning algorithm could be trained to ‘learn’ 
how a dog looks like. It would take an enormous dataset of images 
for it to understand the minor details that distinguish a dog from a 
wolf or a fox.
 66
 67
CONCERNS ABOUT AI TAKING OVER THE WORLD
The computer that wins at games of Chess or Go, is analyzing 
data for patterns. It has no idea it’s playing Go as opposed to 
golf, or what would happen if more than half of a Go board was 
pushed beyond the edge of a table. 
When you ask Amazon’s Alexa to reserve you a table at a 
restaurant you name, its voice recognition system, made very 
accurate by machine learning, saves you the time of entering a 
request in Open Table’s reservation system. 
But Alexa doesn’t know what a restaurant is or what eating is. 
If you asked it to book you a table for two at 6 p.m. at the Mayo 
Clinic, it would try.

 What is Artificial Intelligence
(John McCarthy , Basic Questions)
•
What is artificial intelligence? 
•
It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent 
computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to 
understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods 
that are biologically observable.
•
Yes, but what is intelligence?
•
Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. 
Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some 
machines. 
•
Isn't there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn't depend on relating it to 
human intelligence? 
•
Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of 
computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the 
mechanisms of intelligence and not others.

 What  is Artificial Intelligence?
• Nils J. Nilsson :
– “Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to 
making machines intelligent, and intelligence is 
that quality that enables an entity to function 
appropriately and with foresight in its 
environment.”
271-fall 2017
 What  is Artificial Intelligence?
• Human-like vs rational-like
• Thought processes vs behavior
• How to simulate human intellect and behavior by a 
machine.
– Mathematical problems (puzzles, games, theorems)
– Common-sense reasoning
– Expert knowledge: lawyers, medicine, diagnosis
– Social behavior
• Things we would call “intelligent” if done by a 
human.

 What  is Artificial Intelligence?
Views of AI fall into four categories:
Thinking humanly
Thinking rationally 
Acting humanly
Acting rationally 
The textbook advocates "acting rationally“

– “The exciting new effort to make computers think .. 
Machines with minds, in the full and literal sense” 
(Haugeland, 1985)
• Behavior
– “The study of how to make computers do things at which, at 
the moment, people are better.” (Rich, and Knight, 1991)
• Activities
– The automation of activities that we associate with human 
thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving, 
learning… (Bellman)

Darmouth conference (1956):
McCarthy, Minsky, Newell, Simon met,
Logic theorist (LT)- Of Newell and Simon proves a theorem in Principia 
Mathematica-Russel.
The name “Artficial Intelligence” was coined.

 The Birthplace of 
“Artificial Intelligence”, 1956
•
Darmouth workshop, 1956: historical meeting of the precieved founders of AI met: 
John McCarthy,  Marvin Minsky, Alan Newell,   and Herbert Simon.
•
A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. 
J. McCarthy, M. L. Minsky, N. Rochester, and C.E. Shannon. August 31, 1955. "We 
propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during 
the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study 
is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any 
other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a 
machine can be made to simulate it." And this marks the debut of the term "artificial 
intelligence.“

271-fall 2017
 Agents
• An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its 
environment through sensors and acting upon that 
environment through actuators
• Human agent: eyes, ears, and other organs for sensors; 
hands, legs, mouth, and other body parts for actuators
• Robotic agent: cameras and infrared range finders for 
sensors; various motors for actuators

271-fall 2017
 Agents and environments
• The agent function maps from percept histories to actions:
[f: P* A]
• The agent program runs on the physical architecture to 
produce f
• agent = architecture + program
271-fall 2017
 What’s involved in Intelligence?
•
Ability to interact with the real world
– to perceive, understand, and act
– e.g., speech recognition and understanding and synthesis
– e.g., image understanding
– e.g., ability to take actions, have an effect
•
Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Planning
– modeling the external world, given input
– solving new problems, planning and making decisions
– ability to deal with unexpected problems, uncertainties
•
Learning and Adaptation
– we are continuously learning and adapting
– our internal models are always being “updated”
– ability to deal with unexpected problems, uncertainties
•
Learning and Adaptation
– we are continuously learning and adapting
– our internal models are always being “updated”
• e.g. a baby learning to categorize and recognize animals
271-fall 2017
 Implementing agents
•
Table look-ups, Model-based, Goal-oriented, Utility, Learning
•
Autonomy
– All actions are completely specified
– no need in sensing, no autonomy
– example: Monkey and the banana
•
Structure of an agent
– agent = architecture + program
– Agent examples
• medical diagnosis
• Satellite image analysis system
• part-picking robot
• Interactive English tutor
• cooking agent
• taxi driver

 Task Environment
271-fall 2017
• Before we design a rational agent, we must specify 
its task environment:
PEAS:
Performance measure
Environment
Actuators
Sensors
 PEAS
271-fall 2017
• Example: Agent =  taxi driver
– Performance measure: Safe, fast, legal, comfortable 
trip, maximize profits
– Environment: Roads, other traffic, pedestrians, 
customers
– Actuators: Steering wheel, accelerator, brake, signal, 
horn
– Sensors: Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, 
engine sensors, keyboard
 PEAS
271-fall 2017
• Example: Agent = Medical diagnosis system
– Performance measure: Healthy patient, minimize costs, 
lawsuits
– Environment: Patient, hospital, staff
– Actuators: Screen display (questions, tests, diagnoses, 
treatments, referrals)
– Sensors: Keyboard (entry of symptoms, findings, 
patient's answers)
 PEAS
271-fall 2017
• Example: Agent = part-picking robot
– Performance measure: Percentage of parts in correct 
bins
– Environment: Conveyor belt with parts, bins
– Actuators: Jointed arm and hand
– Sensors: Camera, joint angle sensors
 271-fall 2017
Environment Types
• Fully observable (vs. partially observable): An agent's 
sensors give it access to the complete state of the 
environment at each point in time.
• Deterministic (vs. stochastic): The next state of the 
environment is completely determined by the current state 
and the action executed by the agent. (If the environment 
is deterministic except for the actions of other agents, then 
the environment is strategic)
• Episodic (vs. sequential): An agent’s action is divided into 
atomic episodes. Decisions do not depend on previous 
decisions/actions.
 Environment Types
271-fall 2017
• Static (vs. dynamic): The environment is unchanged while 
an agent is deliberating. (The environment is semidynamic
if the environment itself does not change with the passage 
of time but the agent's performance score does)
• Discrete (vs. continuous): A limited number of distinct, 
clearly defined percepts and actions.
How do we represent or abstract or model the world?
• Single agent (vs. multi-agent): An agent operating by itself 
in an environment. Does the other agent interfere with my 
performance measure?

example: vacuum cleaner world
NO MEMORY
Fails if environment
is partially observable
 Model-based reflex agents
Model the state of the world by:
modeling how the world changes
how it’s actions change the world 
description of
current world state
•This can work even with partial information
•It’s is unclear what to do
without a clear goal
 Goal-based agents
Goals provide reason to prefer one action over the other.
We need to predict the future: we need to plan & search
 Utility-based agents
Some solutions to goal states are better than others.
Which one is best is given by a utility function.
Which combination of goals is preferred?
 Learning agents
How does an agent improve over time?
By monitoring it’s performance and suggesting 
better modeling, new action rules, etc.
